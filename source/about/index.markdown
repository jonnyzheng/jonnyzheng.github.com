I have 8 years software development experience,First 3 years developed Web and WinForm system with Asp.net and C#, then I had chance to use php in project, form that time I start to love linux and opensource. Now my favorite language is ruby, and I'd like to develop website with Rails, they make the things simple and elegant. I also did Android App by java, just for our project. 


At 2011.7 we launched our first startup project [米十网](http://www.riceten.com), user can search menu information of restaurants which provide outside order service in my site by locations.
